# 🌾 NZ Farmer Counselor AI

**Project Tūrangawaewae** — A culturally attuned, AI-powered counselor assistant built for New Zealand’s rural farming community. This assistant provides empathetic, grounded, and resilient support for farmers facing stress, burnout, isolation, and mental health challenges.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This project exists to support those who carry the land on their shoulders. NZ farmers are among the hardest working yet least supported communities when it comes to mental health. This AI assistant bridges that gap — not with fluff, but with real talk, quiet strength, and understanding.
